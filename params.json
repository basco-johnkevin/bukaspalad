It allows for multiple team members to use it at the same time, and helps keep everybody updates by publishing all activity to an update stream.\r\n\r\n##Free (as in Beer) and Open-Source\r\nAs an open-source web application, relief/donation centers are able to download the application, install it locally and use it with or without the internet.\r\n\r\n##Technology\r\n**Bukas Palad** relies on the amazing Twitter Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) for the front-end and the awesome Laravel PHP Framework (http://laravel.com) for the backend.\r\nPHP/MySQL powers **Bukas Palad** since it makes it even more easier to install on any computer as opposed to other technologies (e.g. a person can create a portable version of the whole application, complete with XAMPP and the **Bukas Palad** code).\r\n\r\n#Setting up Bukas Palad\r\nWhen setting up the **Bukas Palad** application, make sure to:\r\n\r\n1. Create a VirtualHost on your web server and point it to the **public** folder.\r\n2. Edit the **application/config/database.php** file credential to match the local MySQL database\r\n3. Edit the **application/config/settings.php** file to edit the Relief/Donation's Center name and the Group Pin to be used\r\n\t- **pin** - the group pin to be used by everyone to log into the system\r\n\t- **group_name** - the group name to show on the home page\r\n\t- **show_group_pin** - set this to **true** to show the pin on the home page\r\n4. Run **php artisan migrate:install** to enable migrations\r\n5. Run **php artisan migrate** to run the migrations\r\n\r\n#Demo\r\nTry out **Bukas Palad** here: http://bukaspalad.appnimbus.com.
